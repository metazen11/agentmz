# Coding Principles

- DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself - consolidate shared logic.
- Abstraction: prefer reusable abstractions and system-agnostic solutions to future-proof integrations.
- TDD: write tests before implementation.
- Security: input validation, no hardcoded secrets.
- Quality: readable code, meaningful names, single responsibility.
- MUST: after code changes, run basic UI checks and confirm core services are operational.
