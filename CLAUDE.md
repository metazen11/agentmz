# Claude Code Directives

> This file exists for Claude Code auto-discovery. The canonical source of truth is **AGENTS.md**.

**MUST review and comply with directives and conventions in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).** Failure to do so can result in decommissioning or termination.

## Claude-Specific Notes

- Claude Code automatically reads this file on session start
- All directives, conventions, and project specs are in AGENTS.md
- This file kept minimal to avoid duplication (DRY principle)
- **No Co-Authored-By attribution in commits** - omit the Co-Authored-By trailer
