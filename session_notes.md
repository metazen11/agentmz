# Session Notes (auto)
- Goal: Fix startup scripts (start.ps1/start.bat/start.sh) so they don't fail on alembic output and browser launches reliably.
- Observed: start.bat exits during alembic upgrade step (NativeCommandError), preventing browser open.
- Services running: wfhub-v2-caddy, wfhub-v2-main-api, wfhub-v2-aider-api, wfhub-v2-ollama, wfhub-v2-db.
- Current request: add LangGraph persistent memory (Postgres) to LangChain CLI, scope per project, retention by age; document status; commit/push.
- Repo state: modified `scripts/langchain_cli.py`, `requirements.txt`, `README.md`; deleted `=42.0.0`; untracked `.venv312/`, `venv/`, `workspaces/poc`.
- Updated: renamed CLI to `scripts/agent_cli.py`, added `.env` defaults, switched memory scope to project name, added tests.
- Defaults: Agent CLI now uses `https://wfhub.localhost/ollama` and LangGraph enabled by default in `.env.example`.
- Default project name for Agent CLI set to `poc`.
- Agent CLI now includes write/apply_patch tools and a unified diff applier.
- Added mkdir/delete/move/copy/stat/list_tree tools for Agent CLI.
- Python cannot resolve `ollama.localhost` (gaierror); curl works. Used `--ollama http://localhost:11435` for LangGraph runs.
- LangGraph created `workspaces/poc/index.html`; manual fix applied to ensure valid animated Hello World.
- Agent CLI prompt now explicitly requests valid HTML5 output.
- Added Agent CLI debug flags to log messages/tools/payloads.
- Added AGENT_CLI_SSL_VERIFY flag to allow TLS verify bypass for local Ollama.
- Latest LangGraph edit test with AGENT_CLI_SSL_VERIFY=0 produced no tool calls; index.html remained invalid. Consider forcing tool_choice="any".
- Added AGENT_CLI_TOOL_CHOICE + AGENT_CLI_TOOL_FALLBACK. Fallback parses JSON tool calls in text.
- qwen3:1.7b pull timed out; still not available.
- Set Agent CLI default base to http://localhost:11435 until HTTPS trust is fixed.
- New request: add deterministic per-model tests for HTML generation and JS edit using runner; agent named Forge, keep system agnostic.
